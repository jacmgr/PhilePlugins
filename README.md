Phile Plugins
============

These are plugins from jacmgr.  They are quirky.  I am not a real programmer.  But I had fun learning about OOP and Phile.

I don't know how to git. Maybe Someday.  You can read about the plugins and download them if you want to see how bad I am.  [Visit my blog about my experience writing these plugins for Phile](http://www.jhinline.com/philecms/three)
